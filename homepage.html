            Hello! I am an Albanian student at İTÜ in Istanbul. I decided to come here with a clear goal: to turn my dreams into reality.

From a young age, I have been captivated by technology, computers, and coding. This passion led me to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering, aiming to become a skilled computer engineer. I am driven by a desire to solve complex problems, innovate, and make a meaningful impact in the world of technology.

I approach challenges with determination and resilience, ready to tackle whatever stands in my way. Hard work, dedication, and a thirst for knowledge define my journey. This is not just a career path for me; it's a mission to grow, excel, and create something valuable.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I hope you enjoy exploring my work.
        </p>
